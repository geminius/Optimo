   - API service testing with mocked responses
   - WebSocket context testing
   - Form validation and user interaction testing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Navigation and routing testing
   - Cross-component communication testing

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete optimization workflow simulation
   - Error handling and recovery testing
   - Real-time update testing
