# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the REST API endpoints that are currently missing from the Robotics Model Optimization Platform. The frontend application is making calls to several endpoints that return 404 errors, and we need to implement these endpoints to provide full functionality between the frontend and backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want to see dashboard statistics when I load the dashboard page, so that I can quickly understand the current state of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard page loads THEN the frontend SHALL make a GET request to `/dashboard/stats`
2. WHEN the `/dashboard/stats` endpoint is called THEN the API SHALL return statistics including total models, active optimizations, completed optimizations, average size reduction, and average speed improvement
3. WHEN no data is available THEN the API SHALL return zero values for all statistics
4. WHEN the request succeeds THEN the API SHALL return a 200 status code with JSON data
5. IF the request fails THEN the API SHALL return an appropriate error status code with error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want to see a list of optimization sessions on the dashboard and history pages, so that I can monitor ongoing and past optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard or history page loads THEN the frontend SHALL make a GET request to `/optimization/sessions`
2. WHEN the `/optimization/sessions` endpoint is called THEN the API SHALL return a list of all optimization sessions with their current status
3. WHEN query parameters are provided THEN the API SHALL filter sessions by status, date range, or model ID
4. WHEN pagination parameters are provided THEN the API SHALL return paginated results
5. WHEN no sessions exist THEN the API SHALL return an empty array with a 200 status code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want to view and update optimization configuration settings, so that I can customize how the platform optimizes models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configuration page loads THEN the frontend SHALL make a GET request to `/config/optimization-criteria`
2. WHEN the GET `/config/optimization-criteria` endpoint is called THEN the API SHALL return the current optimization criteria configuration
3. WHEN the user updates configuration THEN the frontend SHALL make a PUT request to `/config/optimization-criteria`
4. WHEN the PUT `/config/optimization-criteria` endpoint is called with valid data THEN the API SHALL update the configuration and return the updated values
5. IF invalid configuration data is provided THEN the API SHALL return a 400 status code with validation error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want real-time updates on optimization progress through WebSocket connections, so that I can see live status changes without refreshing the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend connects THEN it SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to `/socket.io`
2. WHEN an optimization session starts THEN the server SHALL emit a `session_started` event with session details
3. WHEN optimization progress updates THEN the server SHALL emit `progress_update` events with current progress percentage and step information
4. WHEN an optimization completes THEN the server SHALL emit a `session_completed` event with final results
5. IF an optimization fails THEN the server SHALL emit a `session_failed` event with error details
6. WHEN the WebSocket connection is lost THEN the frontend SHALL display a "Disconnected" status and attempt to reconnect

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want all API endpoints to be properly authenticated and authorized, so that only authorized users can access the platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any protected endpoint is called without authentication THEN the API SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized status
2. WHEN a valid authentication token is provided THEN the API SHALL process the request normally
3. WHEN an expired token is provided THEN the API SHALL return a 401 status with a token expired message
4. WHEN a user lacks permissions for an action THEN the API SHALL return a 403 Forbidden status
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the API SHALL log the user action for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive API documentation for all endpoints, so that I can understand how to use the API correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/docs` THEN the API SHALL display interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
2. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN each endpoint SHALL include request/response schemas, status codes, and example payloads
3. WHEN testing endpoints in the documentation THEN the interactive UI SHALL allow making actual API calls
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the documentation SHALL clearly describe possible error responses
5. WHEN the API is updated THEN the documentation SHALL automatically reflect the changes
