# Task 8: Update API Authentication and Authorization - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive authentication and authorization enhancements for the API, including request ID tracking, WebSocket token validation, admin role checks, and user-specific session access controls.

## Completed Subtasks

### 8.1 Review and Update Authentication Middleware ✅

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Token Verification** (`src/api/auth.py`):
   - Added detailed logging for token validation failures
   - Improved error handling with specific exception types (ExpiredSignatureError)
   - Added `verify_websocket_token()` method for WebSocket authentication
   - Updated permission system to include "config" resource for read access

2. **Request ID Generation** (`src/api/dependencies.py`):
   - Added `get_request_id()` dependency that generates or retrieves request IDs
   - Request IDs are stored in request state for access throughout the request lifecycle
   - Request IDs are included in all error responses via X-Request-ID header

3. **Enhanced Authentication Logging** (`src/api/dependencies.py`):
   - `get_current_user()` now logs authentication attempts with request context
   - Includes request ID, user ID, username, role, and request path
   - Logs both successful authentications and failures

4. **WebSocket Token Validation** (`src/services/websocket_manager.py`):
   - Updated `_handle_connect()` to validate authentication tokens
   - Rejects connections without valid tokens
   - Stores user information (user_id, username, role) in connection metadata
   - Logs connection attempts with user context

**Key Features:**
- All authentication failures are logged with full context
- Request IDs enable end-to-end request tracking
- WebSocket connections require valid JWT tokens
- Structured logging with component tags for easy filtering

### 8.2 Implement Authorization Checks for Configuration Endpoints ✅

**Changes Made:**

1. **Admin Role Check for Configuration Updates** (`src/api/config.py`):
   - PUT `/config/optimization-criteria` already uses `get_admin_user` dependency
   - Added comprehensive audit logging for configuration updates
   - Logs include user ID, username, role, config name, and action type
   - All authorization decisions are logged for audit trail

2. **User-Specific Session Access** (`src/api/sessions.py`):
   - Added authorization check to filter sessions by ownership
   - Non-admin users can only see their own sessions
   - Admin users can see all sessions
   - Checks `owner_id` or `user_id` attributes on session objects
   - Logs access denials with session owner information

3. **Enhanced Authorization Logging** (`src/api/dependencies.py`):
   - `get_admin_user()` logs all admin access attempts
   - `check_permission()` logs all permission checks with resource and action
   - Includes request ID, user context, and request path
   - Logs both granted and denied permissions

4. **Dashboard Authorization Logging** (`src/api/dashboard.py`):
   - Added structured logging for dashboard access
   - Logs user context and statistics retrieved
   - Enables audit trail of who accessed what data

**Key Features:**
- Configuration updates require administrator role
- Users can only access their own optimization sessions
- All authorization decisions are logged for audit purposes
- Comprehensive context in all log entries

## Security Enhancements

## Testing Recommendations

### Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test endpoint without token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/dashboard/stats

# Test with invalid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token"

# Test with valid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>"
```

### Authorization Testing
```bash
# Test config update as non-admin user (should fail)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/config/optimization-criteria \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "test", ...}'

# Test config update as admin (should succeed)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/config/optimization-criteria \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "test", ...}'

# Test session access (users should only see their own)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/optimization/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <user_token>"
```

### WebSocket Authentication Testing
```javascript
// Test WebSocket connection with token
const socket = io('http://localhost:8000', {
  auth: {
    token: '<valid_jwt_token>'
  }
});

// Test without token (should be rejected)
const socket = io('http://localhost:8000');
```

## Verification Checklist

- ✅ All new endpoints require authentication
- ✅ WebSocket connections validate tokens
- ✅ Request IDs are generated and tracked
- ✅ Admin role check on PUT /config/optimization-criteria
- ✅ Users can only access their own sessions
- ✅ All authorization decisions are logged
- ✅ No syntax errors in modified files
- ✅ Structured logging with component tags
- ✅ Request IDs included in error responses

## Requirements Satisfied

- **Requirement 5.1**: All protected endpoints require authentication ✅
- **Requirement 5.2**: Valid authentication tokens are processed normally ✅
- **Requirement 5.3**: Expired tokens return 401 status ✅
- **Requirement 5.4**: Users without permissions receive 403 status ✅
- **Requirement 5.5**: User actions are logged for audit purposes ✅

## Next Steps

The authentication and authorization implementation is complete. The next task in the implementation plan is:

**Task 9: Update OpenAPI documentation**
- Document all new endpoints with authentication requirements
- Add WebSocket connection documentation
- Include authentication examples and troubleshooting

## Notes

- The implementation uses a simple in-memory user database for demonstration
- In production, this should be replaced with a proper user management system
- Session ownership tracking requires the OptimizationSession model to include owner_id or user_id fields
- Consider implementing token refresh mechanism for long-running sessions
- WebSocket authentication uses the same JWT tokens as REST endpoints
