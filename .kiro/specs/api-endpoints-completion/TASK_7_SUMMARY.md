# Task 7: Integrate WebSocket with NotificationService - Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated WebSocketManager with NotificationService to enable real-time event broadcasting to connected clients. The integration transforms NotificationService events into WebSocket events and handles delivery with comprehensive error handling and logging.

## Implementation Details

### Task 7.1: Connect WebSocketManager to NotificationService Events

**What was implemented:**
- Enhanced `setup_notification_handlers()` method with structured logging
- Subscribed to all three NotificationService event types:
  - `notification` events → `_handle_notification()`
  - `alert` events → `_handle_alert()`
  - `progress` events → `_handle_progress()`
- Added helper methods to check connection status:
  - `is_notification_service_connected()` - Check if service is connected
  - `get_notification_service()` - Get the connected service instance
- Updated stats to include NotificationService connection status

**Event transformation flow:**
1. NotificationService emits event (notification/alert/progress)
2. WebSocketManager handler receives event
3. Handler creates async task to broadcast event
4. Event data is transformed to WebSocket-compatible format
5. Event is broadcast to appropriate clients

### Task 7.2: Implement Event Broadcasting Logic

**What was implemented:**

#### Enhanced Broadcasting Methods
All broadcasting methods now include:
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Try-catch blocks around all emit operations
- **Structured logging**: Detailed logs with component context and metadata
- **Graceful failure handling**: Errors don't stop delivery to other clients
- **Delivery statistics**: Track successful and failed deliveries

#### Specific Enhancements

1. **`_broadcast_notification()`**
   - Transforms Notification objects to WebSocket events
   - Routes to session subscribers or all clients based on session_id
   - Logs notification type, ID, and delivery status

2. **`_broadcast_alert()`**
   - Transforms Alert objects to WebSocket events
   - Routes based on session_id
   - Logs alert severity and delivery status

3. **`_broadcast_progress()`**
   - Transforms ProgressUpdate objects to WebSocket events
   - Always routes to session subscribers
   - Logs progress percentage and step name

4. **`_broadcast_to_session()`**
   - Enhanced with delivery statistics tracking
   - Continues delivery even if individual clients fail
   - Logs summary of successful/failed deliveries
   - Handles missing subscribers gracefully

5. **Session Lifecycle Events**
   - `broadcast_session_started()` - Enhanced with error handling
   - `broadcast_session_completed()` - Logs result summary
   - `broadcast_session_failed()` - Logs error details
   - `broadcast_session_cancelled()` - Enhanced logging
   - `broadcast_system_status()` - Logs status summary

## Testing

Created comprehensive integration tests in `tests/test_websocket_notification_integration.py`:

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Setup notification handlers
- ✅ Notification event transformation
- ✅ Alert event transformation
- ✅ Progress event transformation
- ✅ Session-specific notification broadcast
- ✅ Broadcast error handling
- ✅ Multiple event types in sequence
- ✅ Stats include notification service status
- ✅ Session lifecycle events
- ✅ System status broadcast

**Test Results:** All 10 tests passed ✅

## Key Features

### 1. Event Transformation
- NotificationService events are automatically transformed to WebSocket-compatible format
- Timestamps are converted to ISO format
- Enums are converted to string values
- Timedeltas are converted to string representations

### 2. Intelligent Routing
- **Session-specific events**: Broadcast only to subscribed clients
- **System-wide events**: Broadcast to all connected clients
- **No subscribers**: Gracefully handled with debug logging

### 3. Error Resilience
- Individual client failures don't affect other deliveries
- All errors are logged with full context
- Exceptions are caught and logged, never propagated
- Delivery continues even if some clients fail

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
All events include structured logging with:
- Component name ("WebSocketManager")
- Event type and ID
- Session ID (when applicable)
- Delivery statistics
- Error details (when failures occur)

### 5. Monitoring Support
- Connection statistics include NotificationService status
- Helper methods for checking integration status
- Delivery statistics tracked per broadcast

## Integration Points

### With NotificationService
```python
# Setup integration
notification_service = NotificationService()
websocket_manager = WebSocketManager()
websocket_manager.setup_notification_handlers(notification_service)

# Events automatically flow from NotificationService to WebSocket clients
notification_service.send_notification(...)  # → WebSocket clients receive event
notification_service.create_alert(...)       # → WebSocket clients receive event
notification_service.update_progress(...)    # → WebSocket clients receive event
```

### With FastAPI Application
The WebSocketManager is already integrated in `src/api/main.py` and will automatically receive events from the NotificationService once the connection is established during application startup.

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/websocket_manager.py**
   - Enhanced all broadcasting methods with error handling and logging
   - Added helper methods for connection status
   - Improved event transformation logic
   - Added delivery statistics tracking

2. **tests/test_websocket_notification_integration.py** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive integration tests
   - Tests all event types and routing scenarios
   - Tests error handling and resilience
   - Tests session lifecycle events

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Subscribe to progress update events  
✅ **Requirement 4.3**: Subscribe to session status change events  
✅ **Requirement 4.4**: Subscribe to alert and notification events  
✅ **Requirement 4.5**: Transform NotificationService events to WebSocket events  
✅ **Requirement 4.2-4.5**: Broadcast session events to subscribed clients  
✅ **Requirement 4.2-4.5**: Broadcast system events to all connected clients  
✅ **Requirement 4.2-4.5**: Handle event delivery failures gracefully  
✅ **Requirement 4.2-4.5**: Log all broadcasted events for debugging  

## Next Steps

The WebSocket integration is now complete. The next tasks in the spec are:

- **Task 8**: Update API authentication and authorization
- **Task 9**: Update OpenAPI documentation
- **Task 10**: Integrate all endpoints with main FastAPI application
- **Task 11**: Perform end-to-end testing with frontend
- **Task 12**: Performance optimization and monitoring

## Usage Example

```python
# In application startup
from src.services.websocket_manager import WebSocketManager
from src.services.notification_service import NotificationService

# Get singleton instances
notification_service = NotificationService()
websocket_manager = WebSocketManager()

# Connect them
websocket_manager.setup_notification_handlers(notification_service)

# Now all NotificationService events automatically broadcast to WebSocket clients
# No additional code needed - the integration is automatic!

# Example: Send a notification
notification_service.send_notification(
    type=NotificationType.INFO,
    title="Optimization Started",
    message="Your model optimization has begun",
    session_id="session_123"
)
# → All clients subscribed to session_123 receive the notification via WebSocket

# Example: Update progress
notification_service.update_progress(
    session_id="session_123",
    current_step=5,
    step_name="Applying quantization"
)
# → All clients subscribed to session_123 receive the progress update via WebSocket
```

## Notes

- The integration is fully asynchronous and non-blocking
- Event delivery failures are logged but don't affect the NotificationService
- The WebSocketManager maintains its own connection state independently
- All event transformations preserve the original data structure
- The integration supports multiple concurrent sessions and clients
- Memory usage is minimal as events are not stored, only transformed and forwarded
