# Task 12: Performance Optimization and Monitoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive performance optimization and monitoring features for the API endpoints, including caching, database query optimization, and request/response logging with metrics tracking.

## Completed Subtasks

### 12.1 Add Caching for Frequently Accessed Data ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `CacheService` singleton class in `src/services/cache_service.py`
- Implemented thread-safe in-memory caching with TTL support
- Added cache statistics tracking (hits, misses, invalidations)
- Integrated caching into dashboard and configuration endpoints

**Features:**
- **Dashboard Statistics Caching**: 30-second TTL to reduce database load
- **Configuration Data Caching**: 5-minute TTL for optimization criteria
- **Automatic Cache Invalidation**: Cache is invalidated when data is updated
- **Cache Statistics**: Track hit rate, miss rate, and cache size

**Key Methods:**
- `get(key)`: Retrieve cached value
- `set(key, value, ttl_seconds)`: Store value with TTL
- `invalidate(key)`: Remove specific cache entry
- `invalidate_pattern(pattern)`: Remove entries matching pattern
- `get_or_set(key, factory, ttl)`: Get from cache or compute and cache
- `get_statistics()`: Get cache performance metrics

**Integration Points:**
- `src/api/dashboard.py`: Dashboard stats endpoint uses caching
- `src/api/config.py`: Configuration endpoints use caching with invalidation on updates

### 12.2 Optimize Database Queries ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added composite indexes to `optimization_sessions` table for common query patterns
- Optimized SQLite connection settings for better performance
- Improved query structure to leverage indexes effectively
- Consolidated multiple queries into single aggregated queries

**Database Optimizations:**

1. **New Composite Indexes:**
   - `idx_sessions_status_created`: For status + date filtering
   - `idx_sessions_model_status`: For model + status filtering
   - `idx_sessions_created_desc`: For pagination queries
   - `idx_audit_session_timestamp`: For audit log queries

2. **Connection Pool Optimizations:**
   - Enabled WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency
   - Increased cache size to 10MB for better query performance
   - Enabled memory-mapped I/O (100MB) for faster reads
   - Optimized page size (4096 bytes) for modern systems
   - Set temp storage to memory for faster temporary operations

3. **Query Optimizations:**
   - Restructured `list_sessions()` to use composite indexes
   - Optimized `get_session_statistics()` to use single aggregated query
   - Added query logging with execution context

**Performance Improvements:**
- Session list queries now use appropriate indexes based on filter combinations
- Statistics calculation reduced from 5 queries to 2 queries
- Connection pooling reduces overhead for concurrent requests

### 12.3 Add Monitoring and Logging ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive middleware system in `src/api/middleware.py`
- Integrated request logging with timing information
- Added performance monitoring with slow request detection
- Implemented WebSocket connection metrics tracking
- Created metrics endpoint for monitoring

**Middleware Components:**

1. **RequestLoggingMiddleware:**
   - Logs all API requests with method, path, and query parameters
   - Tracks request duration in milliseconds
   - Generates unique request ID for tracking
   - Adds timing headers to responses (`X-Request-ID`, `X-Response-Time`)
   - Logs errors with full context and stack traces

2. **PerformanceMonitoringMiddleware:**
   - Monitors request duration
   - Detects and logs slow requests (>1000ms threshold)
   - Tracks performance metrics (total requests, average duration, slow request rate)
   - Provides metrics via `get_metrics()` method

3. **WebSocketMetricsMiddleware:**
   - Tracks WebSocket connection lifecycle
   - Monitors message send/receive counts
   - Tracks connection errors
   - Provides connection statistics

**Metrics Endpoint:**
- Created `/metrics` endpoint to expose performance data
- Returns API performance, WebSocket, and cache statistics
- Accessible for monitoring and alerting systems

**Integration:**
- Middleware added to FastAPI application in `src/api/main.py`
- WebSocket metrics integrated into `WebSocketManager`
- All middleware uses structured logging with component context

**Logging Features:**
- Structured logging with extra context fields
- Request/response timing
- Error tracking with stack traces
- Component-level logging for debugging
- Event-based logging (request_start, request_complete, request_error)
