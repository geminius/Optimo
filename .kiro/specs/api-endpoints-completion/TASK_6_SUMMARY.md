# Task 6: Set up WebSocket Infrastructure - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates in the Robotics Model Optimization Platform using Socket.IO with FastAPI.

## Completed Subtasks

### 6.1 Install and configure python-socketio with FastAPI ✅
- Added `python-socketio>=5.7.0` to requirements.txt
- Added `aiohttp>=3.8.0` as a dependency for Socket.IO
- Configured Socket.IO server with async mode for ASGI compatibility
- Set up CORS configuration for WebSocket connections

### 6.2 Create WebSocketManager class ✅
**File:** `src/services/websocket_manager.py`

Implemented comprehensive WebSocket manager with:
- **Singleton pattern** for single instance management
- **Connection management**: Track connected clients with metadata
- **Room-based subscriptions**: Clients can subscribe to specific session updates
- **Event handlers**: connect, disconnect, subscribe_session, unsubscribe_session, ping/pong
- **Heartbeat mechanism**: Ping/pong for connection health monitoring
- **Integration with NotificationService**: Subscribe to notifications, alerts, and progress updates
- **Broadcasting methods**: 
  - `broadcast_session_started()` - Session lifecycle events
  - `broadcast_session_completed()` - Completion events
  - `broadcast_session_failed()` - Failure events
  - `broadcast_session_cancelled()` - Cancellation events
  - `broadcast_system_status()` - System-wide status updates
- **Statistics tracking**: Connection counts, subscription metrics

### 6.3 Define WebSocket event schemas ✅
**File:** `src/api/websocket_events.py`

Created comprehensive Pydantic models for all event types:

**Connection Events:**
- `ConnectedEvent` - Connection confirmation
- `DisconnectedEvent` - Disconnection notification
- `ErrorEvent` - Error messages

**Session Lifecycle Events:**
- `SessionStartedEvent` - New session started
- `SessionProgressEvent` - Progress updates with time estimates
- `SessionCompletedEvent` - Successful completion with results
- `SessionFailedEvent` - Failure with error details
- `SessionCancelledEvent` - User cancellation

**Notification Events:**
- `NotificationEvent` - General notifications (info, warning, error, success)
- `AlertEvent` - System alerts with severity levels

**System Events:**
- `SystemStatusEvent` - System health and metrics

**Subscription Events:**
- `SubscribeSessionRequest` - Client subscription request
- `UnsubscribeSessionRequest` - Client unsubscription request
- `SubscribedEvent` - Subscription confirmation
- `UnsubscribedEvent` - Unsubscription confirmation

**Health Check:**
- `PingEvent` - Client health check
- `PongEvent` - Server health check response

**Additional Features:**
- `EVENT_DOCUMENTATION` - Complete documentation for all events with examples
- Helper functions: `get_event_schema()`, `get_event_example()`, `validate_event()`
- Enums for event types, notification types, and alert severities

## Integration with FastAPI

**File:** `src/api/main.py`

Updated main application to:
1. Initialize WebSocketManager in lifespan context
2. Connect WebSocketManager to NotificationService for event propagation
3. Create combined ASGI app with Socket.IO mounted at `/socket.io`
4. Added `create_app_with_socketio()` function for proper app initialization

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Communication**: Bidirectional WebSocket communication using Socket.IO
2. **Event-driven Architecture**: Automatic propagation of NotificationService events to WebSocket clients
3. **Subscription Model**: Clients can subscribe to specific sessions for targeted updates
4. **Connection Health**: Ping/pong mechanism for monitoring connection status
5. **Type Safety**: All events validated with Pydantic schemas
6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: EVENT_DOCUMENTATION provides examples and schemas for all events
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures and cleanup
8. **Statistics**: Track connection metrics and subscription counts

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 4.1**: WebSocket connection established at `/socket.io`
✅ **Requirement 4.2**: Session lifecycle events (started, progress, completed, failed, cancelled)
✅ **Requirement 4.6**: Connection health monitoring with ping/pong and reconnection support

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Connection Testing**: Verify clients can connect and receive confirmation
2. **Subscription Testing**: Test session subscription/unsubscription flow
3. **Event Broadcasting**: Verify events reach subscribed clients only
4. **Reconnection**: Test automatic reconnection after disconnect
5. **Multiple Clients**: Test with multiple concurrent connections
6. **Integration**: Test with NotificationService event propagation

## Next Steps

Task 7 will integrate the WebSocket infrastructure with the NotificationService to enable automatic event broadcasting during optimization sessions.
