# API Endpoints Completion Spec

## Overview

This spec covers the implementation of missing REST API endpoints and WebSocket support for the Robotics Model Optimization Platform. The frontend is currently making requests to endpoints that return 404 errors.

## Status

- ✅ Requirements: Complete
- ✅ Design: Complete  
- ✅ Tasks: Complete
- ⏳ Implementation: Ready to start

## Missing Endpoints Identified

1. **`GET /dashboard/stats`** - Dashboard statistics (total models, active optimizations, averages)
2. **`GET /optimization/sessions`** - List of optimization sessions with filtering and pagination
3. **`GET /config/optimization-criteria`** - Get current optimization configuration
4. **`PUT /config/optimization-criteria`** - Update optimization configuration
5. **WebSocket `/socket.io`** - Real-time progress updates and notifications

## Key Components to Implement

- **Dashboard Router** - Statistics aggregation endpoint
- **Sessions Router** - Session listing with filters
- **Config Router** - Configuration management endpoints
- **ConfigurationManager** - Service for managing optimization criteria
- **WebSocketManager** - Real-time event broadcasting
- **WebSocket Integration** - Connect NotificationService to WebSocket events

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows a 12-task plan:

1. Set up response models and error handling
2. Implement dashboard statistics endpoint
3. Implement sessions list endpoint
4. Create ConfigurationManager service
5. Implement configuration endpoints
6. Set up WebSocket infrastructure
7. Integrate WebSocket with NotificationService
8. Update authentication and authorization
9. Update OpenAPI documentation
10. Integrate with main FastAPI application
11. Perform end-to-end testing with frontend
12. Performance optimization and monitoring

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components (marked as optional for MVP)
- Integration tests for WebSocket event flow
- End-to-end tests with actual frontend
- Load testing for performance validation

## Next Steps

To start implementation:

1. Open `.kiro/specs/api-endpoints-completion/tasks.md`
2. Click "Start task" next to task 1.1 to begin
3. Follow the task list sequentially
4. Mark tasks complete as you finish them

## Notes

- Unit tests are marked as optional (*) to prioritize getting core functionality working
- WebSocket implementation uses Socket.IO for compatibility with frontend
- All endpoints require authentication except health check
- Configuration updates require admin role
