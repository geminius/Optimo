# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI agentic platform designed to automatically optimize robotics models like OpenVLA. The platform will feature autonomous agents that can analyze models, determine optimization opportunities based on predefined criteria, and execute optimizations while providing comprehensive evaluation capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a robotics researcher, I want an autonomous platform that can analyze my models and identify optimization opportunities, so that I can improve model performance without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a robotics model is uploaded to the platform THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze the model architecture and performance characteristics
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify potential optimization strategies based on predefined criteria
3. IF optimization opportunities are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by expected impact and feasibility
4. WHEN optimization recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed rationale for each suggestion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a robotics engineer, I want agents to automatically execute approved optimizations on my models, so that I can achieve better performance without manual implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an optimization strategy is approved THEN the optimization agent SHALL execute the optimization automatically
2. WHEN optimization is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates and progress tracking
3. IF an optimization fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous model state and log the failure reason
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed report of changes made and performance improvements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a model developer, I want comprehensive evaluation agents that can assess optimized models, so that I can verify improvements and ensure model quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model optimization is completed THEN the evaluation agent SHALL automatically run comprehensive performance tests
2. WHEN evaluation begins THEN the system SHALL test the model against predefined benchmarks and metrics
3. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comparison report between original and optimized models
4. IF the optimized model performs worse than the original THEN the system SHALL flag the optimization as unsuccessful and recommend rollback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure optimization criteria and constraints, so that the agents operate within acceptable parameters for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the platform THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set performance thresholds and optimization constraints
2. WHEN criteria are updated THEN the system SHALL validate the new criteria and apply them to future optimizations
3. IF conflicting criteria are detected THEN the system SHALL alert the administrator and request resolution
4. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL log the criteria used for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to monitor and control the optimization process, so that I can intervene when necessary and track progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are running THEN the user SHALL be able to view real-time progress and metrics
2. WHEN monitoring the platform THEN the user SHALL be able to pause, resume, or cancel optimization processes
3. WHEN an optimization completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user with results and recommendations
4. WHEN viewing optimization history THEN the user SHALL be able to access detailed logs and performance comparisons

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a robotics team lead, I want the platform to support multiple model types and optimization techniques, so that it can handle diverse robotics applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading models THEN the system SHALL support common robotics model formats (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
2. WHEN analyzing models THEN the system SHALL identify the model type and select appropriate optimization techniques
3. WHEN optimizing models THEN the system SHALL support techniques like quantization, pruning, knowledge distillation, and architecture search
4. IF a model type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest alternatives
