## Test Implementation Strategy

### 1. Comprehensive Mock-Based Testing
- All external dependencies are properly mocked
- Tests focus on behavior validation rather than implementation details
- Realistic robotics model scenarios and data structures

### 2. Layered Test Approach
- **Validation Layer**: Ensures test structure covers all requirements
- **Integration Layer**: Tests component interactions and workflows
- **End-to-End Layer**: Validates complete user workflows

### 3. Realistic Test Scenarios
- Uses robotics-appropriate models (Vision-Language-Action architectures)
- Includes edge cases and error conditions
- Covers concurrent operations and resource management

## Key Test Features

### Robotics-Specific Testing
- **RoboticsTestModel**: Custom PyTorch model representing VLA architecture
- **Robotics Benchmarks**: Task-specific evaluation metrics (manipulation, navigation, vision-language)
- **Edge Device Constraints**: Hardware limitations and deployment scenarios

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Unsupported model format detection
- Optimization failure scenarios with rollback
- Resource exhaustion and recovery
- Conflicting criteria resolution

### Real-Time Monitoring Validation
- Progress tracking with realistic timestamps
- Resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, GPU)
- Status updates throughout optimization lifecycle
- Process control capabilities (pause/resume/cancel)

## Test Execution Results

```bash
# All validation tests pass
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_requirements_coverage_validation.py -v
# Result: 7 passed, 0 failed

# Coverage validation confirms 100% requirements coverage
✅ Total Requirements: 6
✅ Total Acceptance Criteria: 24  
✅ Coverage Percentage: 100%
```
